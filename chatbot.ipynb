Moreover, it is faster to train as the trees are independent of each other, making the training process parallelizable.\\n\\nA. Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks due to its high accuracy, robustness, feature importance, versatility, and scalability. Random Forest reduces overfitting by averaging multiple decision trees and is less sensitive to noise and outliers in the data. It provides a measure of feature importance, which can be useful for feature selection and data interpretation.\",\n",

This makes random forest very robust to overfitting and able to handle complex relationships between the features and the target variable.Regression is a type of supervised learning algorithm that learns a function to map from the input features to the target variable. There are many different types of regression algorithms, such as linear regression, logistic regression, and decision trees. Each type of regression algorithm makes different assumptions about the relationship between the features and the target variable.\\n\\nThe media shown in this article are not owned by Analytics Vidhya and are used at the Author’s discretion.\\n\\nRelated\\n\\nblogathon\\n\\nrandom forest\\n\\nMachine Learning\\n\\nBecome a full stack data scientist\\nQuestion: what is Random Forest?\\nRelevant text, if any:\"\n",

Random Forest tends to have a low bias since it works on the concept of bagging. It works well even with a dataset with a large no. of features since it works on a subset of features. Moreover, it is faster to train as the trees are independent of each other, making the training process parallelizable.\\n\\nA. Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks due to its high accuracy, robustness, feature importance, versatility, and scalability. Random Forest reduces overfitting by averaging multiple decision trees and is less sensitive to noise and outliers in the data. It provides a measure of feature importance, which can be useful for feature selection and data interpretation.\\nQuestion: what is Random Forest?\\nRelevant text, if any:\"\n",
